# Trajectory Generation Algorithm 
This is an algorithm which uses actuator constrained 9th order polynomial generation to create a minimum time trajectory with a request speed at given waypoints

This algorithm was based off a paper written by Mark Johnson Cutler in 2012 named 'Design and Control of an Autonomous Variable-Pitch Quadrotor Helicopter'

# java-iarc-sim
This is the simulation that we used for machine learning with NEAT

Here is a video about this program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO3ZPPVxk8E
