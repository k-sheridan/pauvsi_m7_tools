# Trajectory Generation Algorithm 
This is an algorithm which uses actuator constrained 9th order polynomial generation to create a minimum time trajectory with a request speed at given waypoints

This algorithm was based off a paper written by Mark Johnson Cutler in 2012 named 'Design and Control of an Autonomous Variable-Pitch Quadrotor Helicopter'
