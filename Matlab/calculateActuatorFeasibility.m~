function [Error] = calculateActuatorFeasibility(Coefficients, Mass, Moment, MaxVel, MaxForce, tf)
%UNTITLED4 Summary of this function goes here
%   This function will test a given set of polynomials to see if they fit
%   within the actuator constraints specified
%   ESSENTIALLY
%   Coefficients: a 3X10 Matrix of coefficients
%   Mass
%   Moment - vector
%   tf: the final time

g = -9.81;

% Find the maximum accelerations
maxima = calculateMaximums(Coefficients, 2, tf);
%now test whether these maximums are within feasible limits
for it = (1:length(maxima))
    %calculate the magnitude of the acceleration gravity while taking into
    %account mass and gravity
    %mag is the [0, 0, 0, F_Total]' vector of the quadrotor. It must not
    %exceed the maximum possible acceleration
    mag = norm();
    if mag > MaxForce
        Error = 1;
        return
    else
        %since it appears that the magnitude of the force is possible
        fprintf('Magnitude of force within reasonable limits')
        %calculate the Fi and Fb vectors and check Fb's sign
        Fb = [0;0;mag];
        Fi = Mass * (maxima(:, it) + [0; 0; g]);
        Fb
        %checking the sign of Fb
        if Fi'*Fb < 0
            Fb = -1 * Fb;
