# Mission-7-Simulation
#New simulation program in Mission-7-Tools. This version is obsolete.

This software's purpose is to learn a top level decision making algorithm using NEAT(Neuro-Evolution through Augmenting Topologies).

The Library we used to implement NEAT is Encog. This library makes implementing NEAT easy.

This simulation software aimed to be as accurate as possible in a one month time-frame. It simulates sensor noise, wheel slip, and randomness.
